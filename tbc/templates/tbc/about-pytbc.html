        <li>Reviewer will have a look at the proposed books, will select an appropriate book and allot to the contributor
        <li>Contributor will be notified to send sample codes for the allotted book (around 10 examples from random chapters) in form of iPython Notebook</li>
        <li><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/tbc-python.fossee.in{% static 'uploads/' %}Sample.ipynb" target="_blank">Sample IPython Notebook</a> for your reference (see additional links for more details on iPython Notebook)</li>
        <li>Contributor sends the required solved examples (sample code) as mentioned earlier in form of iPython Notebook
        <li>Reviewer reviews the pilot examples and gives consent for further work
        <li>Contributor is provided a time period of 2 months to code all the solved examples of allotted book once the pilot examples are approved
    </ul>
    <h4>Stage 2</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Contributor is required to update the progress of the work if the reviewer request
        <li>As soon as the contributor completes coding all the solved examples of the book, the final code should be submitted</li>
        <li>Note: each chapter of the textbook should be a separate iPython Notebook</li>
        <li>Thorough review will be done whenever content is submited &amp; the contributor will be notified for any changes, if required
